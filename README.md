# Float
A game about a paper airplane drifting through progressively unfamiliar landscapes, keep it afloat by interacting with various objects in the environment.

This piece of work is being done as an independent studies project for a student attending Rhode Island School of Design who will be providing the artwork for the game.

The final result should be completed by mid February.
